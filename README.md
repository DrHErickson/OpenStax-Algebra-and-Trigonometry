# OpenStax-Algebra-and-Trigonometry

As a result of an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) Textbook Transformation Grant, we created a series of guided notes, with curated and specially created videos for use with the [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) [Algebra and Trigonometry textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry).
As a result of an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) Textbook Transformation Grant, we created a series of guided notes for use with the [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) [Algebra and Trigonometry textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry). The [guided notes](https://github.com/DrHErickson/OpenStax-Algebra-and-Trigonometry/) contain summaries of the main points of the chapters, extra worked problems, and practice problems. For instructor answer keys, see the note below.

## Homework
We used the low-cost homework system [Edfinity](edfinity.com). Edfinity courses are mapped to specific OER textbooks, and all problems are algorithmic and coded in an open-source problem format. The link to Edfinity's OpenStax Algebra and Trigonometry course is [here](https://edfinity.com/products/5d7281469184305031d25d1a).
